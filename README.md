# about the project
This project really focuses on identifying the areas of St. Paul that are the most dangerous or have a particular kind of crime. I hope that this website will bring awareness of these dangerous areas and cause viewers to stop and think before they go to a certain area, or just to be more aware when they are in those areas. A human person’s dignity is one of the most important things about them, and these crimes take away from that dignity, whether that be through murder, or doing drugs. This website aims at increasing knowledge of crimes to show viewers just how often a human’s dignity is being taken away, and hopefully prompt them to be more aware of it and maybe even take action to try to prevent crime on our own streets!
